# ETL & SQL Portfolio (E-commerce Use Case)

This respository showcases an end-to-end skills in data modeing, transformation, andd business analytics using SQL, Google BigQuery. The project stimulates a realistic e-commerce & retail scenario using dummy data, and demonstrates my abilitiy to design efficient ETL pipeline and perform business-driven analysis.

üìÅ Project Overview
This project is designed to:
- Simulate a small-scale data warehouse for an e-commerce business
- Load and transform data extracted fom Snowflake, Excel, and CSV files
- Model and query the data in BigQuery
- Caclulate key business KPIs and generate insights using SQL

üõ† Tools Used & How They're Applied
- SQL (Google BigQuery)
    Used for all data exploration, transformation, and KPI caclulation queries.
- ETL pipeline Design (Python and BigQuery)
    Designed and implemented simple ETL flows to load data from CSVs and simulate data ingestion from Snowflake exports.
- Data Transformation in SQL 
    Applied CTEs, window functions, and joins to model data for business insights.
- Business Metrics 
    Created KPI queries such as monthly reveune, cusstomer analysis, and top N products performance.
