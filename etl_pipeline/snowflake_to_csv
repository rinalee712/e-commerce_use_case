--Create the internal stage if not already created
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE rina_internal_stage;

--Unload data from a Snowflake table to the internal stage as a single CSV file
COPY INTO @rina_internal_stage/sales_data.csv
FROM my_db.public.sales_table
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = CSV FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY='"' HEADER=TRUE)
SINGLE = TRUE;
