ETL Overview: Load External Data to BigQuery

This document explains the ETL process used to load raw data into Google BigQuery using Python.  
It simulates two types of pipelines:

1. Loading external CSV/Excel files
2. Migrating raw data from Snowflake into BigQuery

## Full ETL Flow ##
[CSV or Excel file]          /      [Snowflake Table]
         ↓                                  ↓
[Python Loader (pandas)]    /      [CSV file via COPY INTO]
         ↓                                  ↓
[BigQuery Table]            /      [Google Cloud Storage (GCS)]
                                            ↓
                                      [BigQuery Table]
